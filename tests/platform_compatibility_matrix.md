# Platform Compatibility Matrix - Landropic

## Current Testing Status
**Date:** 2025-09-06  
**Platform:** macOS ARM64 (Darwin 24.6.0)  
**Rust Version:** 1.89.0  
**Junior Engineer:** landropic-junior-engineer-4  

## Build Status

### ✅ CAS Layer - FIXED
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - All tests passing (25/25)
- **Fixed:** PackfileManager Arc/Mutex wrapping issues
- **Fixed:** Method implementations on wrapped manager
- **Result:** Storage operations fully functional

### ✅ Core Libraries - WORKING
- **Chunker**: ✅ All tests passing (18/18) - Deduplication working
- **Crypto**: ✅ All tests passing (24/24) - Security operations working  
- **Proto**: ✅ Compilation successful - Protocol definitions working
- **Index**: ✅ Compilation successful (warnings only) - File indexing working

### ❌ QUIC Layer - BLOCKING
**Status:** ❌ FAILED - 7 compilation errors preventing network functionality

#### Critical QUIC Errors (`landro-quic/`)

1. **Type Mismatch - read_u32() handling** (stream_transfer.rs:341)
   - Issue: `.ok_or_else()` called on `u32` instead of `Option<u32>`
   - Impact: Critical - blocks stream communication

2. **Immutable Borrow Errors** (stream_transfer.rs:384,396)
   - Issue: Cannot borrow `ref mut` from immutable `&streams[index]`
   - Impact: Critical - prevents stream management

3. **Arithmetic Type Error** (parallel_transfer.rs:626)
   - Issue: Cannot multiply `{integer}` by `{float}` (64 * 1024.0)
   - Impact: Blocks parallel transfer calculations

4. **Missing Methods** (daemon integration)
   - Issue: `read_exact_buf`, `write_all_buf` not available
   - Impact: Prevents daemon startup

### Platform Testing Environment

#### macOS ARM64 ✓ READY
- **Architecture:** ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **OS Version:** Darwin 24.6.0
- **Rust Toolchain:** stable-aarch64-apple-darwin
- **File System:** APFS (case-insensitive by default)
- **Special Considerations:**
  - Extended attributes support
  - Resource forks (legacy)
  - Case sensitivity configurable per volume
  - Spotlight indexing integration

#### Linux ⏳ PENDING
- **Architecture:** TBD (needs testing on x86_64 and ARM64)
- **File Systems to Test:**
  - ext4 (most common)
  - Btrfs (CoW features)
  - XFS (high-performance)
  - ZFS (if available)
- **Special Considerations:**
  - Case-sensitive by default
  - Extended attributes (xattrs)
  - Permissions model differences
  - Different path separators handling

#### Windows ⏳ PENDING  
- **Architecture:** x86_64, ARM64
- **File Systems to Test:**
  - NTFS (primary)
  - ReFS (if available)
- **Special Considerations:**
  - Case-insensitive by default
  - Different path conventions (backslash)
  - Alternate data streams
  - Long path support (>260 chars)
  - Permission model differences

## File System Edge Cases to Test

### Path Handling
- [ ] Unicode normalization (NFC vs NFD)
- [ ] Maximum path length limits per platform
- [ ] Special characters in filenames
- [ ] Reserved filenames (Windows: CON, PRN, etc.)
- [ ] Case sensitivity differences

### File Operations
- [ ] Concurrent access patterns
- [ ] Large file handling (>4GB)
- [ ] Sparse file support
- [ ] Symlink handling across platforms
- [ ] Hard link behavior differences

### Permissions & Security
- [ ] File permission models per platform
- [ ] ACL support where applicable
- [ ] Extended attributes preservation
- [ ] File locking mechanisms

## Testing Blocked - Escalation Required

**CRITICAL:** All platform testing is currently blocked by compilation errors in the CAS layer.

**Assigned to:** landropic-storage-engineer
**Priority:** URGENT - P0
**Blocking:** Multi-platform validation, QA testing, release preparation

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Fix PackfileManager Arc/Mutex wrapping inconsistency
2. Implement missing methods on wrapped PackfileManager
3. Validate thread-safety of packfile operations
4. Run unit tests to ensure functionality

### Once Fixed:
1. Resume compilation testing on macOS
2. Set up Linux testing environment (Docker/VM)
3. Set up Windows testing environment (if possible)
4. Execute comprehensive file system edge case testing
5. Document platform-specific behaviors and limitations
