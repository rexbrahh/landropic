# Landropic Alpha Security Audit

## Audit Date: 2025-09-07
## Auditor: Security Engineer
## Version: 0.1.0-alpha

## Executive Summary

The landropic alpha release has undergone a basic security audit focused on identifying critical vulnerabilities that could compromise user data or system integrity. While the codebase demonstrates good security practices in several areas, there are important limitations that must be clearly documented for alpha users.

## Security Strengths ‚úÖ

### 1. Authentication & Identity
- **Strong key generation**: Uses Ed25519 with OsRng (cryptographically secure)
- **Key zeroization**: Private keys are properly zeroized in memory when dropped
- **No hardcoded credentials**: No secrets or API keys found in code
- **Secure key storage**: Keys saved with 0600 permissions on Unix systems

### 2. Network Security
- **TLS 1.3**: QUIC uses TLS 1.3 exclusively (no downgrade attacks)
- **mTLS authentication**: Mutual TLS for device authentication
- **Certificate validation**: Proper certificate verification with trust lists
- **No plaintext fallback**: All transfers use encrypted QUIC connections

### 3. Code Quality
- **No secret logging**: No sensitive data (keys, passwords) logged
- **Input validation**: Basic validation for device names and chunk sizes
- **Path traversal protection**: Added security module with path validation
- **Safe error handling**: Errors don't leak sensitive information

## Critical Findings üî¥

### HIGH Priority (Alpha Blocking)
None identified - Alpha can proceed with documented limitations

### MEDIUM Priority (Should fix soon)

1. **Missing rate limiting**
   - **Risk**: DoS attacks possible
   - **Impact**: Service availability
   - **Recommendation**: Add connection and request rate limits

2. **No audit logging**
   - **Risk**: Cannot detect or investigate attacks
   - **Impact**: Security monitoring
   - **Recommendation**: Add security event logging

## Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è (Alpha Release)

These are **documented and acceptable** for alpha but MUST be fixed for beta:

### 1. No File Encryption at Rest
- **Current**: Files stored in plaintext in CAS
- **Risk**: Local access exposes all synced data
- **Beta Plan**: Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption

### 2. Test Certificates Only
- **Current**: Self-signed certificates, no CA
- **Risk**: No central trust authority
- **Beta Plan**: Implement proper PKI or trust model

### 3. No User-Level Access Control
- **Current**: Device-level auth only
- **Risk**: All files accessible to any app on device
- **Beta Plan**: Add file-level permissions

### 4. Basic Input Validation Only
- **Current**: Size and path checks only
- **Risk**: Potential for crafted inputs
- **Beta Plan**: Comprehensive protocol fuzzing

### 5. No Memory Protection
- **Current**: Standard Rust memory safety only
- **Risk**: Memory dumps could expose data
- **Beta Plan**: Consider using memsec for sensitive data

## Security Implementations Added

### Path Traversal Protection
```rust
// Added to landro-daemon/src/security.rs
pub fn validate_path(base: &Path, requested: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf> {
    // Canonicalize and verify path stays within base
    let canonical = combined.canonicalize()?;
    if !canonical.starts_with(&canonical_base) {
        return Err(anyhow!("Path traversal attempt"));
    }
    Ok(canonical)
}
```

### Input Validation
```rust
// Chunk size limits
pub const MAX_CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 16 * 1024 * 1024; // 16MB

// Device name validation
pub fn validate_device_name(name: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // Check length, characters, control chars
}
```

### Sensitive Path Detection
```rust
pub fn is_sensitive_path(path: &Path) -> bool {
    // Prevents watching system directories
    // Blocks .ssh, .gnupg, /etc, /sys, etc.
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Test Cases
```bash
# Path traversal test (should fail)
./target/release/landro watch "../../../etc/passwd"

# Large input test (should handle gracefully)
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1G count=1 | ./target/release/landro

# Invalid certificate test (should reject)
# Modify cert and attempt connection
```

## Deployment Guidelines

### Secure Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Run with minimal privileges (not root)
- [ ] Use dedicated user account
- [ ] Restrict file permissions on config/keys
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Enable system firewall
- [ ] Isolate from sensitive data initially

### NOT Recommended For Alpha
- Production environments
- Sensitive/regulated data (PII, HIPAA, financial)
- Corporate networks without isolation
- Systems with compliance requirements

## Security Roadmap

### Beta (Next Release)
1. File encryption at rest (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
2. Audit logging framework
3. Rate limiting and DoS protection
4. Memory protection for keys
5. Protocol fuzzing tests

### v1.0 (Production)
1. Full PKI implementation
2. User-level access control
3. Security audit by third party
4. Compliance certifications
5. Security incident response plan

## Recommendations for Alpha Users

### DO ‚úÖ
- Test with non-sensitive data only
- Run in isolated environments
- Monitor for unusual behavior
- Report security issues immediately
- Keep software updated

### DON'T ‚ùå
- Use for production data
- Expose to public internet
- Trust device pairing over untrusted networks
- Store credentials or secrets
- Disable OS security features

## Conclusion

The landropic alpha is **safe for testing** with non-sensitive data. The codebase shows good security fundamentals with proper use of cryptography, no obvious vulnerabilities, and defensive coding practices. The documented limitations are acceptable for an alpha release aimed at testing core functionality.

**Security Grade: B+ (Alpha Appropriate)**

Key strengths:
- Strong cryptographic foundation
- No critical vulnerabilities found
- Security-conscious development
- Clear documentation of limitations

Required for beta:
- Encryption at rest
