## ðŸš€ Technical Implementations

### Stream Multiplexing Architecture
```rust
// Control channel for sync protocol
ControlMessage::SyncStart { session_id, path }
ControlMessage::ManifestRequest { path }
ControlMessage::ChunkRequest { chunk_hash, priority }

// Data channel for bulk transfers  
DataMessage::ChunkData { hash, data }
DataMessage::FileData { path, offset, data }
```

### Connection Pool Configuration
```rust
PoolConfig {
    max_connections_per_peer: 4,     // Optimal for file sync
    max_total_connections: 50,       // Scales to many peers
    max_idle_time: 300s,            // 5-minute cleanup
    connect_timeout: 10s,           // Fast connection establishment
    max_retry_attempts: 3,          // Robust retry logic
}
```

### Zero-Copy File Streaming
```rust
// Memory-efficient large file transfer
ZeroCopyFileReader::read_chunk(offset, size)     // Direct file access
ZeroCopyStreamWriter::sendfile_to_stream()       // Zero-copy transfer
MmapFileReader::get_slice()                      // Memory-mapped access
```

### Health Monitoring Metrics
```rust
ConnectionMetrics {
    health_status: Healthy/Degraded/Failing/Unhealthy,
    rtt_ms: u64,                    // Round-trip time tracking
    packets_sent/lost: u64,         // Packet loss monitoring  
    bytes_sent/received: u64,       // Throughput tracking
    active_streams: u32,            // Stream utilization
    error_count: u64,               // Error rate monitoring
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Optimizations

### File Sync Optimized Configuration
- **Stream Buffers**: 8MB for efficient batching
- **Flow Control**: 64MB window with 80% backpressure threshold
- **Concurrent Streams**: 64 parallel streams for maximum throughput
- **Stream Timeout**: 30-second timeout with retry logic
- **Memory Management**: Buffer pooling to reduce allocation overhead

### Network Performance
