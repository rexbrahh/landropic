# Landropic Recovery Plan: Tech Lead Directed

## üö® Current Status: CRITICAL - Release Blocked

**Tech Lead Decision**: v0.0.1-alpha release is **BLOCKED** due to compilation failures and broken basic functionality. The sprint added sophisticated features but broke core build system.

**Committed Changes**: Sprint work has been committed (4c652ce) and pushed to main branch.

**New Strategy**: Tech lead takes direct control with specialized task forces working concurrently.

## üìä Assessment Summary

### What We Have ‚úÖ
- **13,528+ lines of new code** committed
- **Advanced architecture**: Bloom filters, resume management, end-to-end sync
- **6 new daemon modules** with sophisticated features
- **Comprehensive testing framework**
- **Security utilities** and documentation

### Critical Issues ‚ùå
- **19 compilation errors** in CLI
- **Daemon hangs** on `--help` command
- **Module integration failures**
- **Broken test infrastructure**
- **Release readiness: 15%** (down from 40%)

## üë• Team Member Assignments

### Senior Engineer (landropic-senior-engineer)
**Primary Focus**: Compilation and integration fixes
**Session Prompt**: 
```
You are a Senior Engineer on the landropic project. The sprint added advanced features but broke basic compilation. Your mission is to fix all compilation errors and restore basic functionality while preserving the architectural improvements.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
1. CLI has 19 compilation errors preventing build
2. Module dependency resolution failures
3. Type system violations in new modules
4. Integration test infrastructure broken

Your priority is getting the codebase to a "compiles and runs" state again.
```

### Systems Engineer (landropic-sync-engineer) 
**Primary Focus**: Module integration and daemon stability
**Session Prompt**:
```
You are the Systems/Sync Engineer for landropic. The sprint added 6 new modules but they're not properly integrated. Your mission is to fix module dependencies and ensure the daemon starts properly.

CRITICAL TASKS:
1. Fix landro_daemon import resolution in tests
2. Resolve module interdependency issues
3. Stop daemon hanging on --help command
4. Integrate new sync modules with existing architecture

Focus on stability first, features second.
```

### Junior Engineer (junior-engineer-landropic)
**Primary Focus**: CLI rebuild and user experience
**Session Prompt**:
```
You are the Junior Engineer responsible for the CLI. The landro-cli has 19 compilation errors and won't build. Your mission is to rebuild it with proper error handling and basic functionality.

IMMEDIATE GOALS:
1. Fix all CLI compilation errors
2. Ensure --help, --version work
3. Implement start/stop/status commands
4. Add proper error messages

Build a simple, working CLI that users can rely on.
```

### QA Validator (landropic-qa-validator)
**Primary Focus**: Build validation and quality gates
**Session Prompt**:
```
You are the QA Validator for landropic recovery. Your mission is to establish quality gates and ensure we don't break working code while fixing issues.

RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Monitor all builds continuously
2. Validate each fix doesn't break other components
3. Restore integration test infrastructure
4. Create automated regression testing

Be the guardian of code quality during this recovery.
```

- **Resource reallocation**: Reassign engineers to critical path
- **Architecture simplification**: Roll back complex features if needed
- **Timeline extension**: Add time if quality requires it

**Bottom Line**: We ship working software, not broken features.

## üöÄ Let's Recover and Ship!

**Tech Lead Commitment**: Direct daily leadership until alpha ships
**Team Commitment**: Focused execution on critical path
