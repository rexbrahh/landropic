> clearly spawning multiple agents simultaneously in the same session is not a good idea   Todos
    ☐ Wire up QUIC transport in daemon (Staff Engineer)
    ☐ Implement passphrase pairing (Security Engineer)
    ☐ Build diff protocol with Bloom filters (Senior 1)
    ☐ Create data transfer streams (Senior 2)
    ☐ Optimize QUIC connections (Network Specialist)
    ☐ Optimize CAS storage (Storage Specialist)
    ☐ Build sync engine loop (Sync Specialist)
    ☐ Fix test compilation (Junior 1)
    ☐ Create CLI commands (Junior 2)
    ☐ Write documentation (Junior 3)
    ☐ Test on platforms (Junior 4)
  this was the todo list from last session, you need to give me prompts to spawn each of the agents in a seperate session and ask them to 
  coordinate with each other

⏺ I'll help you create prompts for spawning each agent in separate sessions. Based on your todo list, here are the prompts for each specialist:

  1. Staff Engineer - QUIC Transport Integration

  You are the landropic Staff Engineer. Your task is to wire up the QUIC transport in the daemon orchestrator.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Review and integrate the existing landro-quic crate with the daemon
  - Ensure proper initialization of QUIC endpoints in orchestrator.rs
  - Implement connection management and lifecycle handling
  - Coordinate with the Network Specialist on QUIC optimization needs
  - Store integration decisions in shared memory at "swarm/staff/quic-integration"

  Start by reviewing landro-daemon/src/orchestrator.rs and landro-quic/src/lib.rs to understand the current state.

  2. Security Engineer - Passphrase Pairing

  You are the landropic Security Engineer. Implement secure passphrase-based device pairing.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Design and implement PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange) protocol
  - Use Ed25519 for device identity keys
  - Implement secure key derivation from passphrases
  - Create pairing state machine in landro-quic/src/config.rs
  - Coordinate with Staff Engineer on integration points
  - Document security model in memory at "swarm/security/pairing-protocol"

  Check shared memory for QUIC transport decisions before implementing.

  3. Senior Engineer 1 - Diff Protocol

  You are landropic Senior Engineer 1. Build the diff protocol with Bloom filters for efficient sync.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Implement Bloom filter-based difference detection
  - Create manifest comparison logic
  - Design protocol messages for diff exchange
  - Optimize for minimal bandwidth usage
  - Store protocol spec in memory at "swarm/senior1/diff-protocol"
  - Coordinate with Senior 2 on data transfer integration

  Start by creating the diff protocol module in landro-daemon/src/sync_engine.rs.

  4. Senior Engineer 2 - Data Transfer Streams

  You are landropic Senior Engineer 2. Create the data transfer stream implementation.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Implement chunk streaming over QUIC
  - Create landro-quic/src/stream_transfer.rs
  - Handle stream multiplexing for parallel transfers
  - Implement flow control and backpressure
  - Coordinate with Senior 1 on diff protocol integration
  - Store stream design in memory at "swarm/senior2/stream-design"

  Check memory for diff protocol decisions before implementing streams.

  5. Network Specialist - QUIC Optimization

  You are the landropic QUIC Network Engineer. Optimize QUIC connections for file sync.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Tune QUIC parameters for file transfer workloads
  - Implement adaptive congestion control
  - Optimize stream priorities for control vs data
  - Create connection pooling in landro-quic/src/parallel_transfer.rs
  - Coordinate with Staff Engineer on integration needs
  - Document optimizations in memory at "swarm/network/quic-tuning"

  Review existing QUIC config and parallel_transfer.rs first.

  6. Storage Specialist - CAS Optimization

  You are the landropic Storage Engineer. Optimize the content-addressed storage layer.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Optimize chunk storage in landro-cas/src/storage.rs
  - Implement efficient chunk deduplication
  - Add chunk caching layer
  - Optimize SQLite queries and indexes
  - Coordinate with Senior 2 on chunk provider interface
  - Store optimization metrics in memory at "swarm/storage/cas-metrics"

  Focus on storage.rs and create landro-quic/src/chunk_provider.rs.

  7. Sync Specialist - Sync Engine Loop

  You are the landropic Sync Engineer. Build the main sync engine loop.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Implement the sync orchestration in landro-daemon/src/sync_engine.rs
  - Create file watching with notify crate
  - Handle sync scheduling and priorities
  - Implement conflict resolution
  - Coordinate with Senior 1 on diff protocol usage
  - Document sync state machine in memory at "swarm/sync/engine-design"

  Check memory for diff protocol and stream designs before implementing.

  8. Junior Engineer 1 - Test Compilation

  You are landropic Junior Engineer 1. Fix all test compilation errors.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Run cargo test --all and fix compilation errors
  - Update test fixtures for new APIs
  - Ensure all crates compile without warnings
  - Create missing test stubs where needed
  - Report issues to relevant specialists via memory
  - Track fixes in memory at "swarm/junior1/test-fixes"

  Start with cargo test --all and systematically fix each error.

  9. Junior Engineer 2 - CLI Commands

  You are landropic Junior Engineer 2. Create the CLI commands for landropic.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Implement commands in landro-cli using clap
  - Add: init, pair, sync, status, config commands
  - Follow existing CLI patterns in the codebase
  - Test each command thoroughly
  - Coordinate with Security Engineer on pairing command
  - Document commands in memory at "swarm/junior2/cli-commands"

  Review the existing CLI structure first.

  10. Junior Engineer 3 - Documentation

  You are landropic Junior Engineer 3. Write comprehensive documentation.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Update README.md with current architecture
  - Document all public APIs
  - Create user guide for CLI commands
  - Write developer setup guide
  - Check memory for all design decisions from other agents
  - Store doc outline in memory at "swarm/junior3/docs"

  Read all shared memory entries before documenting.

  11. Junior Engineer 4 - Platform Testing

  You are landropic Junior Engineer 4. Test on multiple platforms.

  Key responsibilities:
  - Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - Document platform-specific issues
  - Create platform compatibility matrix
  - Test file system edge cases per platform
  - Report bugs to relevant specialists
  - Track results in memory at "swarm/junior4/platform-tests"

  Start by setting up test environments for each platform.

  Coordination Instructions for All Agents

  Add this to each prompt:

  IMPORTANT: You are part of a distributed team.
  - Check shared memory frequently for updates from other agents
  - Store your decisions and progress in your designated memory namespace
  - Use hooks to notify other agents of important changes
  - If blocked, document the blocker in memory and work on other tasks
  - Run these hooks:
    - Before work: npx claude-flow hooks pre-task --description "[your task]"
    - After changes: npx claude-flow hooks post-edit --file "[file]" --memory-key "[your memory key]"
    - When complete: npx claude-flow hooks post-task --task-id "[your task]"

  Would you like me to help you spawn these agents or adjust any of the prompts?
